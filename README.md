# Fake-News-Detection-
Overview
Fake news is a widespread issue in today's digital age, leading to misinformation and societal discord. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect and classify fake news articles by analyzing their content, title, and metadata.

By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model identifies patterns in the text that distinguish fake news from authentic news. This solution can assist media outlets, social platforms, and users in combating the spread of false information effectively.

Key objectives include:

Text Analysis: Understanding linguistic features, such as sentiment, readability, and structure, that can indicate falsehoods.
Pattern Recognition: Using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns indicative of fake news in large datasets.
Real-World Application: Creating a tool to automatically flag suspicious articles for further review, improving the accuracy and efficiency of fact-checking.
This project showcases the potential of AI in addressing societal challenges, highlighting its role in promoting information integrity.

Features
The Fake News Detection system offers the following key functionalities:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleans the text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
Tokenizes text and applies stemming/lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
Converts text to numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizes the distribution of real vs. fake news articles.
Analyzes word frequency, n-grams, and other linguistic features.
Detects trends in article content, such as bias-indicating keywords.
Model Training:

Implements machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Fine-tunes hyperparameters using Grid Search or Randomized Search.
Explores deep learning models like LSTMs, Transformers (e.g., BERT), for advanced feature extraction and classification.
Model Evaluation:

Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the model.
Applies k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
Real-Time Prediction:

Takes an article or headline as input and predicts whether it is likely fake or real.
Provides confidence scores for the predictions.
Dataset
The project typically uses publicly available datasets for fake news detection. Some popular datasets include:

Fake News Dataset (Kaggle):

URL: Fake News Detection Dataset
Description: Contains labeled articles as "fake" or "real." Features include the article text, title, and publication date.
Number of Records: 20,800 labeled articles.
Columns:
id: Unique identifier for the article.
title: The headline of the news article.
text: The main content of the article.
label: Target variable (1 = Fake, 0 = Real).
